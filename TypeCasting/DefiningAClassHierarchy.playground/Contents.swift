//Type casting is a way to check the type of an instance, or to treat that instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its own class hierarchy.

//Type casting in Swift is implemented with the is and as operators. These two operators provide a simple and expressive way to check the type of a value or cast a value to a different type.

//Defining a Class Hierarchy for Type Casting
///You can use type casting with a hierarchy of classes and subclasses to check the type of a particular class instance and to cast that instance to another class within the same hierarchy.
///The first snippet defines a new base class called MediaItem.
///This class provides basic functionality for any kind of item that appears in a digital media library.
///Specifically, it declares a name property of type String,
///and an init name initializer. (Itâ€™s assumed that all media items, including all movies and songs, will have a name.)

class MediaItem {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name

    var director: String
    init(name: String, director: String) {
        self.director = director
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}

class Song: MediaItem {
    var artist: String
    init(name: String, artist: String) {
        self.artist = artist
