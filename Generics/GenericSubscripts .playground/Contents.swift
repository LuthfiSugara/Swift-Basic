//Subscripts can be generic, and they can include generic where clauses. You write the placeholder type name inside angle brackets after subscript, and you write a generic where clause right before the opening curly brace of the subscriptâ€™s body. For example:

extension Container {
    subscript<Indices: Sequence>(indices: Indices) -> [Item]
        where Indices.Iterator.Element == Int {
            var result: [Item] = []
            for index in indices {
                result.append(self[index])
            }
            return result
    }
}
