//Instead of using an ordinary for-in loop, the example above writes for with await after it.
//Like when you call an asynchronous function or method, writing await indicates a possible suspension point.
//A for-await-in loop potentially suspends execution at the beginning of each iteration, when itâ€™s waiting for the next element to be available
